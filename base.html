    <h2>About socality</h2>
    <p>Founded in 2014, Socality is a creative community that exists to inspire people from all walks of life to
        create things that make a difference. Socality began with the simple goal of connecting creatives online and
        in person using social media and live events. Over the years this has grown into a vision that includes
        local community events, workshops, creative camps, online content and storytelling, and collective
        initiatives designed to engage the community at large around projects and organizations.</p>
    <p>In Socality, they often hold one or two house parties at 7 p.m. on the weekends once a month. You can make
        new people at that party who share your interests while also getting your heat on with the guest dj's
        selection of enticing music.Additionally, they will have a Halloween party in November on the evening of the
        28th; if you have the opportunity, attend there.</p>
